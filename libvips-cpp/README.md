# Rebuild of libvips-cpp

This folder contains a copy of the source code for the libvips
C++ bindings, with only very minor changes. We build this as
part of our CMake project. This is not necessary, but it was
helpful while debugging our setup. We may remove this later and
just use the version built with libvips.

The official documentation for `libvips/cplusplus` is in [README.md](./README.md).
